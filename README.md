## Dataset
The dataset consists of traffic collision records, including attributes such as:
- Date & Time of accident
- Location details (Latitude, Longitude, City, Street)
- Weather conditions
- Road conditions
- Type of vehicles involved
- Severity of the collision
- Additional contributing factors

## Technologies Used
This project is implemented using the following technologies:
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (data processing)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)
- Scikit-learn (predictive analysis, if applicable)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Data Processing
The data processing phase includes:
1. **Data Acquisition:** Importing raw traffic collision datasets.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing categorical values.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Extracting useful insights from existing data fields.
4. **Data Transformation:** Formatting and structuring the data for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involves:
- Distribution of collision severity levels.
- Identifying peak accident times and locations.
- Analyzing the influence of weather and road conditions on accidents.
- Correlation analysis between different contributing factors.

## Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations such as:
- Heatmaps for accident-prone areas.
- Line charts for time-based accident trends.
- Bar plots showing accident severity distribution.
- Scatter plots to visualize relationships between variables.

## Findings & Insights
Based on the analysis, key findings include:
- Higher accident rates during specific hours of the day.
- Adverse weather conditions significantly impact accident severity.
- Certain locations are more prone to accidents due to infrastructure.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into traffic collision patterns, enabling authorities to take preventive measures. Further investigation and integration with real-time data can enhance predictive capabilities.
